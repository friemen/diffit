Diff calculates the *edit-distance* and a minimal *edit-script* to
transform the first into the second collection via patch.
The vector based diff implementation follows
[An O(NP) Sequence Comparison Algorithm](https://publications.mpi-cbg.de/Wu_1990_6334.pdf)
by Wu, Manber, Myers and Miller.


## Why

The obvious application of the vector based implementation is diff and
patch of text files represented by seqs of strings.

Another could be the desire to synchronize the final result of a data
transformation (composed of side-effect free functions) with state
wrapped by an expensive mutation-based API, for example a bound JavaFX
ObservableList. A fast diff with a configurable patch is one way to
tackle this.

A 3rd scenario could be the requirement to transmit a minimal amount
of data changes to a remote process for further processing.


There is `clojure.data/diff` but it does not exactly what I had
in mind, as the following REPL output shows:

```clojure
(clojure.data/diff [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8] [1 3 4 5 6 9])
;= [[nil 2 3 4 5 6 7 8] [nil 3 4 5 6 9] [1]]
```

The docstring says that the resulting triplet contains
`[things-only-in-a things-only-in-b things-in-both]`. However, the
common sequence `[3 4 5 6]` is part of the first two, so the result is
not a minimal edit-script.


Next stop was [clj-diff](https://github.com/brentonashworth/clj-diff),
but unfortunately the good work never made it into a non-snapshot
release. My implementation is from scratch, but - of course - contains
insights from existing open source work such as `clj-diff` and others.


## Usage

There are two namespaces: `diffit.vec` and `diffit.map`. Each contains
a `diff` and a `patch` function.

`diffit.vec/diff` and `diffit.vec/patch` work for sequential things
which will be treated as vectors.

`diffit.map/diff` and `diffit.map/patch` work for associative things.

Let `x`, `y` both be sequential or associative, respectively:
 * `(diff x y)` produces a *diff-result* which is a pair of
   `[edit-distance edit-script]`.
 * `(patch x diff-result)` applies the edit-script in diff-result to
   `x` in order to reproduce `y`.
 * It holds that `(= y (patch x (diff x y))`.


In the REPL:

```clojure
(require '[diffit.vec :as v])
;= nil
(v/diff [1 2 3 4] [1 2 7 8 4])
;= [3 [[:+ 2 [7 8]] [:- 4 1]]]
```

The diff-result is a pair: the first part is the
[edit-distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance), the
second part is a sequence of edits (called an *edit-script*) that is
needed to produce the second input collection from the first.

The edit-script for vectors allows sequential processing in the
`patch` function with insert and remove operations, where insert takes
a sequence, a position and a sequence to insert, and remove takes a
sequence, a position and a number of items to remove. Positions are
zero-based.

The edit-script in the output above can be read like this:

* First, add the sequence [7 8] at position 2 (this will shift the items 3 4 to the right).
* Then, remove 1 item at position 4.

Once you have the result from `diff` you can apply its edit-script with `patch`:

```clojure
(v/patch [1 2 3 4] diff-result)
;= [1 2 7 8 4]
```

The `patch` function can be used with two or three, respectively, additional
arguments to hand in functions that actually do the insert, remove,
assoc, dissoc or replace operation. This lets you adapt `patch` to an
API based on mutation.


For a Java `ArrayList` here's a corresponding snippet:

```clojure
(patch (fn [l index item]
		 (.addAll l index item)
		 l)
	   (fn [l index n]
		 (dotimes [_ n] (.remove l index))
		 l)
	   mutable-list	diff-result)
```

For Java `HashMap` this looks like this

```clojure
(patch (fn [m k v]
         (.put m k v)
         m)
       (fn [m k]
	     (.remove m k)
         m)
       (fn [m k v]
         (.put m k v)
         m)
       mutable-map diff-result)
```



## Performance for vector based diff

`diffit.vec/diff` is a slight bit better than the
[clj-diff](https://github.com/brentonashworth/clj-diff) implementation
which uses the same algorithm and was also built with performance as
key requirement. Both clearly outperform the 1.3.0 version of an open source
Java library called
[diffutils](https://code.google.com/p/java-diff-utils/).

(So far, I did no extensive research for other Java alternatives. If
you find a better candidate that handles Java lists, and not only
text, drop me a mail.)


### Setup

I tested it for 2000 items where the sink `bs` was derived from the source
`as` by randomly adding or removing items. Add/remove took place
with 10% probability each, so 80% of the sink is the same as the
source.

This snippet defines source and sink sequences:

```clojure
(do (def as (range 2000))
    (def bs (rand-alter 80 10 10 as))))
```

Here's the piece of code that creates the sink from the source vector:

```clojure
(defn rand-alter
  [pass-prob remove-prob add-prob xs]
  (let [ops (vec (concat (repeat pass-prob :=)
                         (repeat remove-prob :-)
                         (repeat add-prob :+)))]
    (reduce (fn [xs x]
              (case (rand-nth ops)
                :+ (conj xs x "-")
                :- xs
                := (conj xs x)))
            []
            xs)))
```

I used [criterium](https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium) `bench` to
gather times on a JDK 1.8.0_5 with Clojure 1.6.0 and 4 cores of
`Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 CPU M 560 @ 2.67GHz`. Here are the results:

## Performance for map based diff

Unsurprisingly, the `diff` for maps is an *order of magnitude faster* due
to the performance characteristics of the underlying datastructures.

I did no comparison between different libraries (are there any?) or
implementations.
